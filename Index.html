        <h1>Gender gap in financial literacy</h1><br>
        <p>While most women manage the household and take smaller financial decisions, the bigger decisions are typically left to the men. Another reason for low literacy is the deliberate exclusion of woman from financial matters by men to retain an upper hand.
            <br>
            <br>
            At any stage of life, be it before marriage or after, the prime reason for women’s dependence on men is financial illiteracy or lack of awareness about finances. When it comes to global financial literacy, 70% of women are illiterate compared with 65% of men.

            <h1>Women & Financial Literacy</h1><br>
            <p>Managing money in the midst of life’s other priorities is no easy task. Women of all ages and backgrounds struggle with the pressure to earn enough, access education, care for a family and plan retirement.
               <br>
               <br>
                Taking the initiative to educate yourself about complex financial decisions will help you achieve your next major milestone. Every informed financial decision you make gets you closer to that goal.</p>
